Create a File system using NodeJs. This should be a webapp.

You can proceed in following steps:-

1. Designing a data structure to store file and folder with their metadata.
2. Use a database to store it. ( can use simple JSON based file too)
3. Now create a `/browse` API endpoint this receives a query parameter as `path` and based on that you can able to explore the file system.
4. Create a `/create` API endpoint that receives parameters as path, content, type(file or folder).
5. Similarly create and API endpoint for `/delete`. 
6. Organise above in a way that it feels like a proper file-manager. (like adding a dialogue for creating a file/folder etc.)

### Bonus: 

1. Create `/update` API endpoint. 
2. Integrate the Update API above properly in UI flow.
